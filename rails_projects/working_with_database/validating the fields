validating the fields

Go to the model something.rb and write the validation there.

Ex:
class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates :title, presence: true

end


this means that title is required.


On the console, if there's a problem to save something, you can use:

article.errors.any? (returns true or false if there's an error)

article.errors.full_messages (shows the error message)
